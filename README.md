In addition to Manshar’s mission of spreading the culture of blogging in Arabic and contributing to the Arabic content, Manshar also aims at gathering the best Arab developers around the project by making it open source and available for anybody interested to join, to spread the culture of collaborating and contributing amongst the developers community as well.

Manshar was launched by [Mohammad Khatib](https://plus.google.com/+MohammadKhatib/posts), a Web Developer at Google, as an effort to contribute to solving the problem of lack of Arabic content online by providing better tools that makes it easier to create and consume Arabic content.
